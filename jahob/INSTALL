Jahob preliminary version of 23 July 2006.

This version adds the following key improvements implemented by 
  Charles Bouillaguet that joins the Jahob team:

  * TPTP interfaces to first-order theorem provers
  * SPASS interface
       (try downloading executables with as eprover and SPASS)
  * Coq interface
  * complete hiding of objects

It also incorporates numerous improvements for Bohne, developed
by Thomas Wies, and a new version of verification condition generator
written by Viktor Kuncak, invoked by -sastvc.

There are other features and changes that are currently not
documented, but we decided to release the updated sources
anyway.  Documentation should appear in a few months at
most.  We have more extensive set of libraries and a
regression suite that you can run

Instalation instructions (verified under Debian distribution with kernel
Linux 2.6.8-1-686-smp #1 SMP Thu Nov 25 04:55:00 UTC 2004 i686 GNU/Linux).

Required:
  make
  ocaml distribution (tested woth ocamlc version 3.09.1)

Instalation instructions: 
  Untar the distribution
  Type make to create bytecode compiled versions
    This will produce executable bin/jahob directory
  Type 
     cd src; make -f Makefile.opt depend; make -f Makefile.opt ../bin/jahob.opt
     This will produce native code compiled executables.

  We run executables by doing cd into the appropriate example subdirectory
  and then running something like:

    ../../../bin/jahob JavaFile1.java JavaFile2.java -method JavaFile1.methodName -nobackground -usedp mona isa cvcl

  Executables will place their temporary files in
  the ../tmp/ directory relative
  to where their position.

Jahob can use the following external programs 
(with the corresponding executable names):

 MONA - used for analyzing linked data structures
   http://www.brics.dk/mona/

 Isabelle cvs snapshot from 24 February 2005 - useful fallback
   http://www4.informatik.tu-muenchen.de/~isabelle/

 CVC Light (or other SMT-LIB compatible prover; we only tested it with CVCL)
   http://chicory.stanford.edu/CVCL/
        
 Simplify, not essential (Simplify)
   only minimal support

 Omega Calculator (oc)
   http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/omega/

 LASH executable, not essential (presburger)
   - an alternative for Omega, usually worse
